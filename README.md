# Smartreads

Smartreads is your personal and literal 'book'mark companion. Smartreads allows you to search for books and add them to your list which may be one 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' and 'Save for Later' so that you can keep track of your books effectively. 
It is developed with React JS and the routes are managed with React Router. The backend makes use of the Goodreads API under the hood.
